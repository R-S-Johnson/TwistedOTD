Discord bot for Dandy's World (currently **ONLY** for private use)

Dandy's World is a Roblox "Rooms style" game; this is a subcategory of rogue-like games that has players traverse through contained areas (usually separated by an elevator trip, door, or other distinct boundary), completing each area's task before continuing on, with a goal of getting as countably far as possible (these games usually include this count on-screen in game).

In Dandy's World, players play as one of many "Toons" that descend down a shotty elevator, extracting Ichor into machines on each floor to keep the elevator working, while dodging their Ichor infested counterparts (Aka: Twisteds). Some of these Twisteds are especially dangerous to encounter, but are an extremely rare spawn on any floor.

This is where the Twsisted Board comes into play. In the home spawn area there is a wooden board that displays one of the less common Twisteds. That Twisted's chances of spawning are increased for the day. This bot sends an automated message when the Twisted Board updates with the new more common Twisted of the day.

Currently a private bot, working on adding necessary features and protections for public use!
